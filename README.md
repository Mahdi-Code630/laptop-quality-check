# Laptop Quality Check

This project is a simple programming exercise that checks whether the assumption *"a more expensive laptop always has better quality"* is true or not.

## 📌 Problem Description
- You are given `n` laptops.  
- For each laptop, two integers are provided:
  1. **Price**
  2. **Quality**

If there exists a pair of laptops such that the more expensive one has **lower quality**, then the program prints:

happy irsa

Otherwise, it prints:

poor irsa

---

## 🚀 How to Run
Run the Python script (`main.py`) and provide input in the following format:

1. First line: an integer `n` (number of laptops).  
2. Next `n` lines: two integers per line → `price quality`.
